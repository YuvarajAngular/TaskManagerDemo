 frontend (React Native + Redux + Redux-Saga) and backend (Core PHP + MySQL).

Project Title: Simple Task Manager App
Tech Stack: React Native, Redux, Redux-Saga, Core PHP, MySQL

Frontend (React Native + Redux + Redux-Saga)
Build a mobile app with the following features:

1. Login Screen
->Email & Password fields
->Input validation
->Trigger login API via Redux-Saga

Technical Expectations
React Native functional components + hooks
Redux for global state management (token, task list, UI states)
Redux-Saga for:

->Managing side effects
->Token storage & retrieval
->Proper folder structure (actions, reducers, sagas, services, components)
->Axios for APIs
->React Navigation

->PDO for database connection
->Token-based authentication (JWT or custom)
->JSON responses
->Input validation
->Proper error handling

Submission Requirements
README containing:
->Setup instructions
->API endpoints
->Database schema
->Postman collection

A short note explaining:
->What you would improve with more time
