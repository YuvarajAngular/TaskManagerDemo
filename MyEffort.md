# Future Improvements: Code Structure

With more time, I would focus on the following structural improvements:

### 1. Unified Architecture (Monorepo)
*   Restructure the project into a Monorepo to enable code sharing between Web and Mobile.
*   Centralize shared logic, constants, and TypeScript interfaces.

### 2. Standardization & Type Safety
*   Implement backend-driven type generation to ensure synchronization between API and Client.
*   Rename `Frontend` to `Mobile` for clarity.

### 3. Refactoring
*   Break down large components into smaller, reusable units.
*   Centralize services (like Notifications) to improve maintainability.
